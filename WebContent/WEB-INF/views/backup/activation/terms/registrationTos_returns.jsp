<h1>Terms of TruConnect Service Plan</h1>

<p>These terms for the TruConnect Service Plan are subject to the TruConnect General Terms of Service, which is
  available on our website http://www.truconnect.com</p>



<h2>TruConnect Service Plans</h2>



<p>TruConnect provides you with the option to pay by the megabyte for your service. At times our service plans
  change or need adjustment. Customers currently on a changing or expired service plan may continue to use them until

  such time as we elect to cease offering these plans.</p>



<p>Please note that only devices purchased from TruConnect will allow you to take advantage of our one of a kind
  data plan offerings. If you have a device with built in 3G capability this device will not work with the TruConnect
  service plan. You will need to purchase a TruConnect device.</p>



<h2>Current Service Plans</h2>



<h3>The TruConnect Plan</h3>



<p>
  To activate your TruConnect Plan visit https://activate.truconnect.com. To maintain your account there is a $4.99
  monthly access fee. After the access fee, each megabyte (MB) of data costs 3.9&cent;. The payment methods are
  specified in the <b>Payment Method</b> section of this document. See both <b>Automatic Top-up</b> and <b>Monthly
    Recurring Charges</b>
</p>



<p>Your account balance never expires unless conditions occur as specified in the Payment Method section of this
  document. If you suspend or deactivate your account, your account balance will be forfeited. Monthly access fees are
  non-refundable. To reactivate your account, visit https://activate.truconnect.com and follow the same process as your
  initial activation. Your account balance will follow the same process of setting up a new account.</p>



<h2>Payment Method</h2>



<h3>Automatic Top-up</h3>



<p>Our service plan uses Automatic Top-up to ensure you are never left without mobile Internet access when you need
  it. The minimum top-up amount is $10.00. We may allow you to select a greater top-up dollar amount. When you activate
  your account your selected top-up amount will be charged to the credit card ("payment method") you provide. As you use
  your TruConnect Plan, 3.9&cent; will be deducted per megabyte (MB). At the end of each session we will calculate your
  usage rounded up to the nearest whole megabyte. If actual usage is 1.7MB you are charged for 2MB of data usage. When
  your balance falls below $2.00 your primary payment method will be charged your selected top-up amount. This payment
  will occur each time your account balance falls below $2.00 to prevent an interruption in the service we provide you.
  Your account credit will never expire unless you terminate your account. If your payment method is declined and you
  fail to update your payment method your balance will be used to pay your monthly subscription dues because of the
  expired payment method. Once the balance runs out and you have not provided us with an authorized credit card your
  account will be deactivated. Once you provide us with a valid credit card your service will resume.</p>



<h3>Monthly Recurring Charges</h3>



<p>Your monthly access fee will be due on the same day of the month being the day you initially signed up for your
  data plan. We will deduct all monthly recurring charges for your TruConnect Plan from your primary Payment Method
  every month. If your Payment Method is declined your account balance will be used to cover the monthly access fee. If
  your primary Payment Method is declined and you do not have sufficient funds in your account and have no secondary
  authorized Payment Method credit card on file, your service will be stopped until you provide another valid Payment
  Method.</p>



<h2>Checking Your Balance</h2>



<p>You may check your balance at any time free of charge by visiting https://manage.truconnect.com and logging into
  your account. Actual account usage for billing purposes may differ from the amount shown in your account. Your account
  balance may not be accurate due to delays of information reporting on your account usage. This functionality is
  provided as a service to you and not as the real-time status of your account although we strive to make the two match
  as closely as possible. TruConnect will post the final charges to your account within 30 days of after the charge is
  incurred.</p>



<h1>General Terms of Service</h1>

<h2>Account History</h2>

<p>Your account history for the previous 60 days is available online at http://www.TruConnect.com unless you switch
  service options, in which case your account history for your new service option will be available online for a period
  of up to 60 days following the date of your switch. You can request a printed statement detailing 60 days of account
  history by calling TruConnect customer service at 1-855-878-2666. If you request an account history beyond the last 60
  days, you may be assessed a processing fee. If you deactivate your service or change your mobile phone number, you may
  obtain your account history by contacting TruConnect customer service at 1-855-878-2666.</p>



<h2>Taxes &amp; Surcharges</h2>

<p>Stated prices for our services do not include certain taxes or surcharges. We charge applicable state and local
  sales taxes on all purchases made through our website at http://www.TruConnect.com, including Automatic Top-Up
  transactions that we process directly. In certain states, retailers (including TruConnect) are required to collect
  e-911 fees for Top-Up transactions that they process. Charges may also include a surcharge for federal and state
  Universal Service Fund contributions and state and local 911 fees, as well as a cost recovery surcharge. The amount of
  these surcharges is subject to change and may vary from time to time and by geographic area. Surcharges are assessed
  to help defray our costs incurred in complying with federal and state telecommunications regulations. Surcharges are
  not taxes or fees that the government requires from consumers. Taxes, fees and surcharges are subject to change
  without notice.</p>



<h2>Charges</h2>

<h3>General</h3>

<p>Charges are deducted from your account balance that is maintained by your credit card ("Payment Method") on file
  with us. If you have incurred charges or fees that were not charged prior to your account balance reaching zero, we
  may deduct these outstanding unpaid charges and fees from any subsequent amounts you add to your account balance.</p>

<h3>Additional Charges</h3>

<p>Please contact TruConnect Customer service at 1-855-878-2666 or visit our website at http://www.TruConnect.com
  for additional pricing information or answers to any questions about our services. Calls to TruConnect may be
  monitored and recorded for quality assurance purposes.</p>

<h3>Disputed Charges</h3>

<p>If you think that there has been an error in any charge to your account, you must notify us within 30 days after
  the charge appears on your account. Call TruConnect customer service at 1-855-878-2666, and one of our advisors will
  investigate your claim. If you do not notify us within 30 days, you waive any right to dispute the charge, including
  in arbitration or a court proceeding. If we determine that the disputed charge was inappropriate and was raised by you
  in a timely manner, we will credit, refund or provide other compensation to you. If we credit, refund or provide other
  compensation to you to settle a disputed charge, you agree that the dispute is fully and finally resolved and not
  subject to further proceedings. We are not liable for any charges for products or services provided by third parties
  through and for use on our mobile phones, devices and network. If an unauthorized or disputed charge for a third-party
  product or service appears in your account history, you must contact that third party directly.</p>

<h3>Account Suspension Related to Credit Card Chargebacks</h3>

<p>If we have attempted to charge your authorized payment method for a charge that we deem is authorized and valid
  under the Terms of Service, and the credit card company withholds such payment because the charge has been disputed (a
  "Chargeback"), we reserve the right to suspend your access to our service until the Chargeback is reversed. If your
  account is reactivated, you may be charged a fee for each Chargeback. Since all service provided by TruConnect is

  pre-paid, if your payment method is declined your account will be suspended and you will no longer be able to use the
  service until you reactivate your account by activating on the website and paying the monthly access fee.</p>



<h2>Refunds and Returns</h2>

<h3>Refunds For Automatic Top-up and Monthly Fees</h3>

<p>Automatic Top-ups are non-refundable. Monthly access fees are non-refundable.</p>

<h3>Account Suspension</h3>

<p>You may suspend your account at any time free of charge. Your monthly access fee will keep your account active
  through the last day of the calendar month. You are free to use your service until this time. Beginning the next month
  you will not be charged the $4.99 monthly access fee. You will not be charged a monthly access fee nor have access to
  our 3G mobile broadband service while your account is suspended. You must login at https://manage.truconnect.com to
  reactivate your account. Upon reactivation your monthly access fee will be prorated so you pay only for the remaining
  days in the month. Your service begins immediately when you reactivate your account.</p>

<p>
  Devices purchased directly from us through our website at http://www.truconnect.com may be returned for a full refund
  within 30 days of purchase. You must have the original receipt, packaging materials and all components. Please contact
